Library Management System

Project Description

The Library Management System is a Python-based application that provides an intuitive way to manage books, users, and authors in a library. Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), this system enables users to perform operations such as adding, borrowing, returning, and searching for books, as well as managing user and author records. This project demonstrates modular programming, encapsulation, and error handling.
